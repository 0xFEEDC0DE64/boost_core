[section:noncopyable Header <boost/core/noncopyable.hpp>]

The header `<boost/noncopyable.hpp>` defines the class
`boost::noncopyable`. It is intended to be used as a private
base. `boost::noncopyable` has private (under C++03) or
deleted (under C++11) copy constructor and a copy assignment
operator and can't be copied or assigned; a class that derives
from it inherits these properties.

`boost::noncopyable` was originally contributed by Dave
Abrahams.
