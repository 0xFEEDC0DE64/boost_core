[section:addressof Header <boost/core/addressof.hpp>]

The header `<boost/core/addressof.hpp>` defines the function
template `boost::addressof`. `boost::addressof(x)` returns the
address of `x`. Ordinarily, this address can be obtained by
`&x`, but the unary `&` operator can be overloaded.

`boost::addressof` was originally contributed by Brad King
based on ideas from discussion with Doug Gregor.
